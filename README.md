The new scripts are: Damageable, Attack, and DetectionZone

Damageable deals with giving player/enemy damage
Attack deals with checking if the AttackPoints overlap
DetectionZone deals with Enemy AI and whether or not the enemy can attack the player; only does this if the DetectionZone object overlaps with the player.

These scripts utilize Layers in determining whether or not the object is a Player, Enemy.
